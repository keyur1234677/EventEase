# EventEase

Coplit helped create the initial prototype of the EventCard with validation and two-way data binding. Coplit also helped assisted in providing the initial routing between the components. Additionally, Copilot helped refine the navigation wiring between event list, details and registration pages. It also helped optimize the code to view Event Details. Finally it helped to build registration form with validation, user session tracker for state management and an Attendance Tracker. It also helped me troubleshoot an error with Attendance tracker page not finding the registered users.
